<!--so here's the deal...I waited til the last minute and there's some stuff I could not figure out how to fix in time. This is my best shot. I need to fix the area at the top with my name, I will need some help with that though. -->

					<p class="stuff_about_me">I am not sure what I'm doing with my life, like many people my age. I have a bachelors in math with a minor in art, because that makes sense. I spend a lot of my free time practicing martial arts, it keeps me sane and oddly enough keeps me from losing it and hurting someone. My daydream job would be to be a singer, second place would be to get a decent income as an artist. I paint a lot. </p>
					<br><br>
					<p class="stuff_about_me">So my goal right now is to get a job that pays well enough for me to relax about bills enough to sing and paint in my free time. I would also love to write. I have a gazillion book ideas that I think would sell really well, but I don't make enough money to have health insurance so I'm trying to get to where I don't have to worry about basic needs. Hence, my attendence in this coding bootcamp.</p>
